# ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Sales Forecasting  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project applies time-series and machine learning models to forecast daily sales for an e-commerce / FMCG platform.  
The goal is to help businesses make smarter decisions around **inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and revenue management** by predicting future demand patterns.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals  
- Transform raw sales data into a clean, structured dataset  
- Detect **seasonality, spikes, and anomalies** using exploratory analysis  
- Train forecasting models: **ARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost**  
- Compare performance with metrics (**RMSE, MAE, MAPE**)  
- Build an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** for testing models and forecast horizons  
- Convert model results into **practical business insights**

## ðŸ›  Tools  
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, XGBoost, Prophet  
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly  
- **Deployment**: Streamlit  
- **Version Control**: GitHub  

## ðŸ“Š Workflow  
1. **Data Preparation** â€“ Aggregate and clean sales data  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** â€“ Identify seasonality and demand trends  
3. **Modeling** â€“ Build ARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost forecasts  
4. **Dashboard** â€“ Deploy interactive forecasts with adjustable horizons  
5. **Insights** â€“ Translate results into business recommendations  

## ðŸ”® Model Insights  
- **Prophet**: Captures long-term trends and seasonality well.  
- **ARIMA**: Good for short-term forecasting, weaker at seasonal patterns.  
- **XGBoost**: Strong validation accuracy but future forecasts tend to flatten without engineered features.  

**Takeaway:**  
- Use **Prophet** for long-term planning.  
- Use **XGBoost** for short-term demand spikes.  
- Combining both could yield the most reliable results.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard  
The Streamlit app allows users to:  
- Select forecasting models (Prophet / ARIMA / XGBoost)  
- Adjust forecast horizon (30â€“180 days)  
- Compare error metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE)  
- Switch between **validation mode** and **future mode**

## ðŸš€ Status  
- âœ… Models trained and dashboard deployed  
- ðŸ”„ Next: test hybrid models and add holiday/promotion effects  

## ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings  
- Built a complete **ML forecasting pipeline**  
- Compared traditional time-series and ML models  
- Learned trade-offs between **accuracy vs interpretability**  
- Deployed results in an **interactive app** for business use
